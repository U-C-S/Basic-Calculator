This was my first learning project using C# and This project took me a week to finish off because I want to make it for good UX. Yeh, Anyone could build a Simple Calculator in a day. But, For good UX, Believe me it's not that easy. That explains many things like why things made quickly don't have good UX most of the times. 

Also, This is my first time using Visual Studio 2019 Community
